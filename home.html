        <p>Hi, I'm a high school senior from Calcutta. I like to swim, solve rubiks cubes, eat pancakes and draw dinosaurs (especially brachiosaurus). Oh, and I love to code, infact, I made this website entirely using HTML and CSS (and a lot of googling). You can find the source code at my <a href="https://github.com/JumpinDumplin">Github</a> page. I also write software and build stuff that I think is cool. Right now I'm learning how to build scalable AI models ready for deployment, mainly using Python and open-source tools.
